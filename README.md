## 🛠️ Technologies  
This template uses the following tools and libraries:  
- **React.js**: Core framework for building UI.  
- **Redux (Toolkit, Saga)**: State management with support for side effects.  
- **TypeScript**: Strict type safety and enhanced development experience.  
- **Sass**: Preprocessor for styling.  

## ⚙️ Engine
And what's under the hood?
- **SWC**: which is faster than the usual build option  
- **Plugins**: It took several days and about a year of experience to set up the collector perfectly so that you get the minimum build at the exit!

## 🚀 Quick Start  

### Prerequisites  
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js (v20.17.x) installed.

   cd <project-directory>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:  
   ```bash
